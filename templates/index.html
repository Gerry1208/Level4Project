            <h1>Welcome to Names!</h1>
            <h4>The Names app helps you to learn the names of the students in your tutorial group(s) - accessible <a href="/names/groups/">here</a> or on the navigation bar above.</h4>
            <h4>You can learn the student names in 3 ways:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Study the list of names and pictures
                </li>
                <li>
                    Test yourself using the Multiple Choice Quiz - a face will be shown to you with a number of names underneath - pick the right one
                </li>
                <li>
                    Test youself using the Self Marking quiz method available - again a face will be shown to you but you only have to think who it is, then reveal the answer to see if you were correct. <br>
                    If you got it wrong, take the time to study the name and face, try to learn it for next time.<br>
                    Score yourself right or wrong and move onto the next image
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Research into learning has shown that testing is better than studying, as the mental act of trying to recall the name helps strengthen pathways in the brain</h4>
            <h4>The Self Marking method has stood out as the best method of learning</h4>
            <h4>Thank you</h4>
